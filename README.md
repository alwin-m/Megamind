## 💻 Minimum Hardware Requirements

### 🔹 For Quantized Versions (Recommended)
For general users and developers who want reasonable speed and efficiency:

| Component | Minimum Requirement |
|------------|--------------------|
| **GPU (VRAM)** | 6–8 GB (e.g., NVIDIA GTX 1060 6GB or RTX 3060 Ti 8GB) |
| **System RAM** | 16 GB (minimum) |
| **CPU** | Intel Core i5/i7 or AMD Ryzen 5/7 |
| **Storage** | 10–20 GB of free SSD space |

> ⚡ Tip: Quantized models (e.g., 4-bit or 5-bit) reduce VRAM usage with only a minor accuracy drop — ideal for laptops and mid-range desktops.

---

### 🔹 For Full Model (FP16 Precision)
If you want to run the complete, uncompressed FP16 model:

| Component | Minimum Requirement |
|------------|--------------------|
| **GPU (VRAM)** | 16–20 GB (e.g., RTX 4080/4090 or Apple M3 Max) |
| **System RAM** | 32 GB or higher |
| **Storage** | 20–30 GB SSD |

---

### 🔹 Running on CPU Only
If you don’t have a dedicated GPU, you can still run it entirely on CPU:

| Component | Minimum Requirement |
|------------|--------------------|
| **CPU** | Intel Core i7 or AMD Ryzen 7 (8+ cores recommended) |
| **System RAM** | 16 GB (minimum) — 32 GB preferred |
| **Performance** | Slower inference speeds, but fully functional |

> 💡 Note: For best performance, using a GPU or Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) is strongly recommended.

## 🧩 Operating System Compatibility

| OS | Status | Notes |
|----|---------|-------|
| **Windows 10/11 (64-bit)** | ✅ Supported | Native Ollama app available |
| **macOS (Apple Silicon or Intel)** | ✅ Supported | Runs efficiently on M1/M2/M3 chips |
| **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian/Fedora)** | ✅ Supported | CLI-based installation; same commands apply |
